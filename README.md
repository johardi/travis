T.R.A.V.I.S : Totally Right Asking Very Intelligent System
```

This project is a derived work from NLP-Reduce technique by Lorenz Fischer.

```
NLP-Reduce is a natural language query interface that allows its users to enter full English
questions, sentence fragments, and keywords.  It processes queries a s bag of words and only
employs a reduced set of natural language processing techniques, such as stemming and synonym
expansion.

Dependencies between word or phrases in the queries are only identified by the relationships
that exit between the elements in a queries knowledge base. This weakness is also its major
strength, as it is completely portable and robust to ungrammatical or deficient input.
